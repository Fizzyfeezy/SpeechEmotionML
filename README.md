# Machine Learning Model Repository

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model in Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`). The model is designed to perform a specific task (mention the task, e.g., sentiment analysis, image classification, etc.).

## File Structure

- **`main.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the machine learning model implementation.
- **`data/`**: Folder containing the dataset or data used by the model.
- **`saved_model/`**: Folder containing the saved machine learning model files.

## Running in Jupyter Notebook

To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SpeechEmotionML
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in your browser and ensure to install required library.

## Running in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

1. Open VSCode and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   code SpeechEmotionML
   ```

2. Open `main.ipynb` in VSCode.

3. Run the notebook cells using the "Run All Cells" option or run cells individually.

## Usage

- Follow the instructions and code in the `main.ipynb` notebook to understand and use the machine learning model.
